CRCUTI, standing short for "Container Runtime for Clusterized Unix-alike Terminal Interaction", is a System Container Runtime I thought of making for Kubernetes, since other projects that revolved around Container Runtimes were dropped on this GitHub account, meaning I decided to step up my coding skills in Golang and C++, and do something that is nearly impossible. Yes, this will take quite a long of time, especially considering that I'm a solo developer doing this project.

(wish me luck)
